`You think we want new furniture
a stove some major appliance
We only ask because
we can't get what we want.

That old stereotype about women spending money,
wanting jewelry,
wanting more more more

That's what we fall back on
when we can't get what we want.

A new house, a new car, new drapes are all far
from the truth of what we really seek.

Can't you see in our night eyes
Don't you feel the red silk of our negligee
Have you forgotten the smell of our essence?

Why can't you hear our request
through the lines?

We want you

And when you can't give us yourself anymore
we give up
and ask
for a dog.

Sometimes, when I go out on a new date, I
feel like I'm sixteen again.
I'll rifle through my closet, deciding I have
absolutely nothing to wear.
He'll pick me up, and we'll go to a
restaurant with deer heads on the walls,
and we'll have whiskey sours, and we'll
struggle with the lettuce leaves in
the salads because they're too big, and
when we're done with dinner we'll go
to a bar that's so crowded and so loud that
we won't be able to talk to each
other, but we'll have to stand real close.
And then he'll take me home and I'll invite
him in, he'll sit on the chair,
I'll sit on the couch, and he'll ask for a glass
of water. When we can't
think of any more small talk, and the clock
says 3:12 a.m., I'll see him to
the door, he'll kiss me good-bye, and I'll
lock the door after he leaves. And
when I'm sure he can't see me through the
window, I'll turn on the stereo and
dance in my living room before I go to bed.

Moon in the sky
Clouds on the ground
Lost in mass wonder
Falling from sound
How do you stop suddenly?

The tires of a car screamed loudly
On the freshly dampened pavement
Into the cold, dry night air
And there was a thud
Like a twenty pound sack of potatoes
being lobbed onto the deck of a boat
And then a new scream
Not quite as loud
But more dramatic than the first
And then there was a body

There was a kid, a boy
Scarcely fifteen years old
Stoned, happy, thinking, dreaming
Walking home in the dusk
From the party he'd just left
The soft, wet air pressing
Upon his face, and moistening
His jacket.

As he lifted each foot forward
He carelessly let it fall
To the sidewalk without looking
Where he was going.
He'd been this route a million times
And knew it by instinct.
The lights and colors
Were all on his side
So, without even thinking
He stepped off the rough, hard curb
And into the street.

The driver was frightened
By the sound of the screams
As his auto came to a halt.
And somehow, slowly
He got out
Staggered
Glanced downwards
Muttered
Staggered back
Got back in
And drove away
Fast.

Often I sit upon the bridge
That looms above the freeway
And dream into the night air.
The cars rush by underneath
Sounding like huge swells and waves
Rolling, crashing across the pavement
And the road surfers grip their
Wheels of death, firmly, as they weave
In and out through traffic.
Similar to the way
The wave riders of history
Guide their crafts through
The spinning, falling tubes of excitement.

How fast does it take
To kill yourself in a car?
How fast does it take to die?
Within the blink of an eye?
Or a quick question why?
Is life just a lie?
I wonder and sigh...

A few small questions, reservations
all requiring confirmations.
When you do, such comes to you
in many forms, and feelings too
with no remorse, forget regret -
I see you every day and yet
it’s not enough, I want more:
I want to walk you through a door
and then a hall, far blurred walls
where we could dance a waltzish ball,
just you and I, cheek on cheek
and in my ear a breathy squeak;
on my heart, gone's the ice,
your dress - liquefaction’s nice.
I’m pressed close, starts the heat,
your dress melts to floor of suite
steam from each, on each it lights
on terrace wind it makes its flight
famished hearts had nought to eat
expert tongues where life's not sweet
talk is dull expendable
passion shapes the floating hull
that transports us from mold to new
you with me and I in lieu
of your dream, unattained
but in life is now ordained.

Ahead this scene, so much precedes
because of morals' basic needs
but basics shrink less to lessers
when beyond is soft caressers
and the thought, at the core
that after this is so much more 
Father Time walked out on Mother Nature
He said “I’m tired of being your metronome”.
Mother replied “I need your help to keep things in order.
The world would be in entropy if I were left alone”
Father was tired of the job that came with matrimony.

He slammed the door behind him as he clutched the keys in his fist
Then he realized that the pistons would no longer fire right,
So he smiled and threw the keys back at the house
breaking the window,
landing with broken glass at the feet of the crying mother
With her elbows in her knees
And her face in her hands

It was time for Father to do his own thing
Time to explore the space he formerly regulated
Time to fuck time
“Maybe I’ll go check out the sixties again.”

“What about the children?” Mother moans to herself
Then she shoots to her feet with a wry equilibrium
“What about the children!”
she screams through the broken window
“What children?” Father replies
“They don’t even recognize us anymore”

Mother Nature watches
as Father Time walks off into the riddled distance
His body demolecularizes and fades into the wind

In a small beach town,
less than two hundred miles south of Haight Ashbury
Some young surf hippies load another bong as they wonder
what happened to the waves
And Bob Marley misses a beat,
Jerry Garcia finally comes back from his long strange trip
A stringy haired sibling inhales a stream of smoky
canaboids behind the gurgling sounds of water
And John Lennon runs by the window naked
Screaming out “I’ve never been born.”
The poor man knew what it meant not to have a father
How fortunate for us
This time.
inside his heart
she saw light
crying to get out
and follow a dream in the sky
he was darn and silent
only her magic could turn
winter to spring
and he was in love
together they flew
and twirled a silly song
upon time
they went slowly at night
and nestled in a cocoon
where they were happy...


I want to write a poem that will get me laid
I wanna drop the bomb upon every woman
That will make them believe I’m the hottest thing

See, I’m not as cool as McQueen or James Dean
I can’t keep a poker-face if I’m holding more than a king
I don’t have a Kirk Douglas chin with a gritty smile
Or Fred Astaire grace, flawless in style
I don’t embrace the force like Obi One Kenobi
I don’t have money like Trump or hair like Bon Jovi

I want to write a poem that will get me laid
My words will have to be tactful
Subtle, yet unafraid
Sublime words that will softly stroke
The pulse of her femininity
Taunting words with feathery trails
That will tantalize a need for remedy

I don’t have an athletic build
I’m not in the top of my field
(I don’t even have a field)
I don’t have the charm of a secret agent spy
Or dark mysterious eyes
I just have this compass with a magnet jammed in its side
I want to write a poem that’ll get me laid
It would have to build me an air
Of sensuality and knowingness
Try to keep that slow, grinding, beat
Smoky, jazz funk, fluid heat

An indistinct warmth that will have to be satisfied
The rising of yawning lust
Like a vapor
Deep inside

Yeah, that’s the way
I’m gonna write a poem that will get me laid
One that will drive her
Drive her to the very brink

But... But... But...
I think I just ran out of ink


twenty two checks are all one needs
there need not be security or control
just twenty two checks
perhaps a jacket,
with black and white stains
or maybe some oversized socks
I know she shouldn’t be doing this
but it feels so good
twenty two checks and
our Christmas is saved
twenty two checks and santa
is as fat and jolly as ever
are they kidding? don’t they know?
my mother has twenty two checks
a lot of things to buy
she’s not through yet,
where are you going
mom I need you to help me escape
from your insanity
which is so appealing
in its innocence and infanity I want
twenty two checks and
a black and white smeared coat
to become you is my greatest object
and of fear I run from you
because I am the last of the great
mother lovers and twenty two checks
is nothing to me
it’s simply another exercise of your godliness

I pray
to your apotheosis
what would monsignor lawler say
if he were to love us now
we are no longer apart,
but partners in crime together
I’ll chase the pigs from the pen
and run with you into
our great neckian utopia
and pretend that we sit around
the tape recorder listening to your authoritarian,
entrepreneurial begetter
ask us what we want.
as our turn comes around
we will whisper quietly
twenty two checks!
and santa will come
and give us our book of ecstasy
come lets go
to all those vultures who wait
in their decorated nests for
our twenty two checks which
may never come true,
simply scribblings upon a paper
which will eventually be cashed in
for parker’s with black
and white spills that come to signify
our innocence and incapability in a
scientific world where numbers must
match ledgers and people must be
paid for their black and white atrocities
the elasticity of their economy
depends upon us
we are needed to give them meaning
and truth we signify
the vilified other half which
gives them the mirror through
which they primp their angled nostrils
come lets give them
something to do today
we‘ve got twenty two checks
and a new cross pen
let’s write them our love letter which
will only be sneered at
let’s give them notes about us
let’s invite them into our
world which they could never understand
22 checks fifteen hundred dollars
its all the same to us
the balancing act bored
the greatest minds of the experiment
we must push the acrobat
from the tightrope on purpose
watch him hit the ground painfully hard
and wonder why equilibrium fueled his fall
why balance
finally claimed him
consumed him devoured him
the unbalanced principle is ours and
will not be understood
by those acrobats who have something to lose when their
balance is jeopardized
let us unbalance the world set it to rights
and cash our
twenty two checks twenty two times in
twenty two different ways.


How horrible a thing is death:
Non-consciousness, absence of breath.
Life’s predestined start we celebrate,
Yet how arbitrary its ending,
Determined by fate.
Horrible death: monumental
(Then why so pending an event?)
Perhaps the cure to the habit of life is Insignificant.

How troublesome a thing is dying:
An utter end for one,
For few a cause for crying.
For the rest in existence a speck in the eye
(At most a reminder that they too will die)
Such a nuisance, a disruption—
There’s work to be done!
How selfish is man’s great horror of death
For it troubles only one.


Men love sluts my best
friend’s cousin
croons, a sixteen year old authority
fresh from juvenile hall.
So we push up our 12 year old baby tits.
add mascara and body glitter.
Pose for our own approval.

That summer my friend disappears
not seen again ‘til age 17.
I’m clerking that year at the drugstore.
She comes in with a drug addict’s face,
housewife’s hands, no wedding ring.
Purchases some diapers.
averting her eyes from mine.

High school I find a new best friend
with a different name and haircolor
but the same weak, pretty voice.

Helpless at pleading no,
at twisting her body under his,
she comes back to school in her
mother’s glasses, hiding two black eyes.
Her world reduced to hospital vials
praying for the monthly tremble of blood,
a negative HIV result.

She recovered into a softer voice
and a shakier walk.
Started splaying her ivory candlestick legs
at a strip club on the other side of town.
Lost her name to Honey.

So I should have known better
than to make love to a man
who entered me like he was walking on stage.
Thinking I’d leave something more
behind than lipstick stains on his carpet,
hair clogging his drain.

This city is full of girls
who paint their mouths
the color of whores’ fingernails,
thinking they’ll find
a man who’ll love them.
Men love sluts.
but not the way they love their Mamas,
not the way they love Jesus.


Morning pushes amber fingers of light
through the blinds,
but here
the sun amounts to nothing.

Even the bed is wrong.
Busy sheets, fat pillows.

She longs to lose
her insect flesh
in the white sterility of a hospital.
To have nurses, needles,
eat up the overabundance
of the hours.

She hates herself. But she is beautiful.
Skin like
white porcelain:
Toilet.
Teeth.
One will rot the other.

There are easier ways to die,
but none dizzier
than slowly vomiting yourself
back into the corner
you think you belong to.

Girls wait
for lovers with fingers like
delicate birds
to teach them how to fly.

Mothers, tell your daughters.

Too many of my sisters
are crouching in the corner,
wearing their bodies
like wounds.
my life is that rare bootleg always illegal if you speak it
the women who leave me love me
from porch swing views I lose
all the birthday wishes I've ever spit up on cake
my home is heated, the outside grows and growls
everything gets bigger except my outlook. 
Loaded to middle
Pickled and pure
Plastered like putty
Blind as a door
Stewed boiled and juiced
Polluted and poor
Jagged over heels
Oiled and sore
Smashed like a pumpkin
As full as a tick
Sozzled and tanked
Full to the tip
With black teeth afloat
Sefaring in the suds
Swazzled and Zonked
One more was then chugged
Lit up like a Christmas tree
And high as a kite
Blue around the gills
Bosko Absoluto Bosky that night
Stinkarooed stiff
I was knee walking drunk. 


he's a 4 prong plug in a 3 prong world
not wired into the rest of us. always
thinking of snakes and dancing, all elbows,
in sunlit corners with dust motes and dreams

but she loves him
when he whispers words. the words
that slither. tingle with her sadness
as they make love on the futon
in a circle of candles melting
on hardwood floors warped
with the rings of beer bottles
left when the empties are tossed

and she has to believe
in the letter that never comes
in the genius nobody sees
to keep from drowning herself
in the deep fat fryer down at the mall
giving into a dark so empty
of dust motes and dreams
these pink plastic things are a piece of shit
I apply pressure to my cuts and nicks
and imagine pink pubic hairs peeking out
of purple and green plaid panties
a real tight fit
oh manic panic curly cues
how I miss you
speaking of dos
I’ve paid mine in don’ts
and thank you god for almost a bob
one more inch and I’m in the clear
from bald to buzz to shag in a year
I think I’ll bleach streak when it fits
snugly behind my ear
and I was nine the first time
I saw a woman with an armpit full
of curly dark hair
and I’ll never believe there’s more stars
than grains of sand
I left the beach with a migraine and a tan
and an image of a woman with
parts like a man
and I would look sexy with a goatee
or a mustache spiraled
and waxed like Dali
would you still be seen with me
if I played that part
side parts
middle parts
where I take shelter in the dark
I braid and adorn her armpits
with plastic clips
sometimes I feel like I’m being cradled by Patti Smith
with an added twist
a surprise
bleached and dyed
you think you can’t believe your eyes
peek-a-boo between her thighs
I just can’t kick the image of you
so I lick my lips
and toss my bic
and watch as my stubble grows in
soft and thick 
I EXTINGUISH MY CIGARETTE
AND CHECK FOR LUMPS IN MY BREAST
AND CAN’T TELL WHAT’S MUSCLE
AND WHAT’S TISSUE AND WHAT’S NOT
ANOTHER APPOINTMENT TO PUT OFF
I SHOULD BE MAKING SMALL TALK
WITH A BIG NURSE WHO SAYS
“HONEY, LEAVE YOUR CLOTHES ON THIS CHAIR.”
I SAY WHO CARES
OR SPITTING INTO A TINY SINK ON WHEELS
WAITING TO GET MY OTHER CAVITIES FILLED
WHICH REMINDS ME
I FORGOT TO POP A CERTAIN PILL
A LITTLE PREVENTATIVE MEDICINE
SO I PLAY IT SAFE
AND TAKE TWO JUST IN CASE
AND IMAGINE PISS IN A CUP THAT I DROP
AND IT SPLATTERS ALL OVER ME
AND YOU’RE ALL OVER ME
AND IF I ENJOYED SEX WITH YOU
THIS AGGRAVATION WOULD SEEM JUSTFIED
I GIVE YOU YOUR FILL
I OPEN WIDE
BECAUSE SUGAR IS A POIGNANT REMINDER
THAT SOME THINGS I CAN’T PUT OFF FOREVER
A LAUGHING GAS SHOWER MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
AS I GATHER MY NOVOCAIN THOUGHTS TOGETHER
I DECIDE THAT SOME HABITS ARE WORTH BREAKING
AND SOME RISKS ARE NOT WORTH TAKING
AND CANCER RUNS IN ALL OF OUR FAMILIES
THROUGH AND THROUGH
LIKE I AM WITH YOU
AND I WANT TO BE SO OLD
THAT THERE’S NOTHING NEW 


In a corner upstairs
hung between the dresser’s brown baseboard and the bare floor
the husk of a moth
sucked empty by some long-gone spider
twists slightly in its silk missing a breeze.
Brittle as old paper.
Faded to the cream of the graduation dress
in the box in the top right drawer
folded with the letters of your best friend dead of the flu
as the first war ended.
How neat the ribbon, how fine the hand, how pale.

Down streets
workaday deserted from the airport to the church,
flurries of cottonwood swirl at the windshield like dull, dry snow.
Everywhere, peonies flouncing.
Everywhere, copses of round trees.
Everywhere, land exhausted to order;
no strength for chaos;
streams turned to ditches, thickets to hedges
nature to farmyards,
to flower-capped fairies with dragon-fly wings and elves
floating rose petal boats down the margins of children’s books,
to calendar photos of old barns crumbling in snow.

you wouldn’t wouldn’t go
won’t
you told them
go
Won’t stop leaking.
Slowly dripped dry, my darling
you are done denying life.

Out back
the pine Ed cut last autumn to protect your roof
swells with sap,
its stump a spring gushing summer
the whisper of needles and clusters of nuts.
Brave roots, eager and naļve, betrayed.
April’s tease to August’s tart--
clotted. Staled and spoilt.
The future’s fermenting.
It stinks.

Far away a day ago
the phone rings and time freezes.
Phone always ringing,
we bask in the instant,
in its kindness,
before we knew for sure.
Death by long distance.
Death by long distance
from birth
from respect
from caress.

They’ll sell everything you ever touched
from tables in the front yard:
fifty cents for this, for that a nickel.
They’ll sell the rats you couldn’t hear
scutter through the pasteboard to their nest in the foldaway bed.
They’ll sell the soft brown rings which have crept across the ceiling
staining twenty years now
though you never saw more than the so-pleasing paper royal blue,
its gilded buds and circles seared into your tissue
by the waiting
when your boys left home to fight the second war.

Once
behind the goat house
trees bloated with cherries
would grab and tickle
till they stained your lips and fingers full blood red.
No one now recalls the last harvest,
so sunk in memory it could be a lie.
Could be a hope.
Could be something sweet and sticky was one day welcome here.

Death by long distance from berries,
from juice.
Death by long empty distance
from love and its mindless corruption.

Did you want to die alone?
Did you choose it?
Or embarrassed to the last bodily function
did you die ashamed that someone might see?

Frail, confused, my winter-grayed, windblown leaf,
you slide
you wheel
you sail into the past tense.

Someday
your toothpick pelicans will languish on a dusty thrift shop shelf
next to pipe cleaner mermaids in tiny seashell hats
dear once to somebody else.
Some soon day someone drags the upstairs bureau
down a hallway as skinny as your shoulders
to be dumped out-of-doors.
Testing the fringes of their world with delicate limbs,
all the busy spiders extend the edges of their webs
enlarging the firmament.
Unremembered moth
has dropped
and shivered to dust.

I fly northeast.
I touch your coffin.
I fly home.


A ten a.m. samba,
the sun warming the bed.

I wake inside you,
one skin stretched over two bodies.

Lizards doing push-ups to cool ourselves off.


Coats, soothes, relives and treats me like choking vomit my love fucks with the Russian Roulette of AIDS she's in Boston,

I'm standing, living here. afraid of knocks. Evil is the natural. Good is the bastard you must rationalize do nothing, pay nothing, fuck nothing, your food is sour, your heart dissipates, the landlord changes locks.

Shave to keep up appearances. Effort to live. The church dumpster. Fined for recycling

If dark is the meat of the evil why do bad men starve all night so close to the steps of city hall? My trig calculator. Same battery for 8 years off and on, yet the effort is still necessary a shotgun to 1 of us is all
Bodies upstairs, sprawled across
sheets of flowers, cars, and comic book heroes
while their dreams stretch across galaxies.
Yeah, all the astronauts, firefighters, and ballerinas
running from giants,
flying through the air
All the while, snuggling the blankets closer.
Their chests rising and falling
like little seesaws
breathing laughter into their dreams.

Other bodies upstairs,
Tossing and turning on comforter matched sheets
While their dreams stretch
so tight, they almost snap.
Yeah, all the engineers, managers, and accountants
running in slow motion,
traveling in driverless cars,
all the while, pushing the blankets off,
blaming the night sweats on Nightmares

A stark white light bounces off the
glistening, shimmering tile of the bathroom
and echoes down the hallway.
It reaches out for another light in the darkness,
but does not find it till
morning creeps through the window
like an adulterer sneaking home.


I know a girl
who met a heroin addict
He was hungry, she had food,
he’s lived with her a year now.

I know a girl and we used to be friends,
tearing through topics on old school benches,
talking about sex and
smirking at the realities of our peers.

She was my prom date, senior year.
Sturdy bodies under lace, boys stared,
wondered if we had suckling sessions.
Our teacher fingered the fabric of our dresses,
took pictures we never saw.

Now she calls me at unnerving intervals,
tells me cocaine is making her skinny,
almost a cryptic referral.
She says all the boys want to fuck her.
She says she doesn’t remember how.

Says she’s a cocktail waitress;
gave up on girlish dime-a-dozen dreams
of waiting for long-maned angels/men
to whisper her body clean.

I saw her the other day,
barefoot, retrieving windblown mail.
She was tiny, almost small enough
for getting lost in a quiver of fear.


NAKED, SHARING A CIGARETTE
WE EXCHANGE TERRIBLE LIES
BENEATH THESE STAINED SHEETS
WE MEAN SOMETHING STRONGER
THAN THE DEFINITION
OF THESE DISTORTED LOVE POEMS
I BREATHE INTO YOUR NECK

I’M LOSING MY MIND WITH YOU
INSIDE ME
THERE ARE PLACES IN ME
YOU CAN NEVER GO
MEMORIES
NO
SCREAMING TO MEET YOU
NO
SLIDE OVER ME
SLICK ONTO ME
TAKE AWAY
MY DREAMS
It was the pain she drank the stuff
That was colored dark & brown
Without the warning of a word
The fire & liquid brought her down

Her craft a game where will the same
Would make them stand away from her
Come what will & here she is
For I am not & if she were

The reason I laughed & cried today
The reason I thought I'd died today
And on her & in her throat
Sucked & died each word I wrote. 
Whackedout and fucked up at the moment
because of yesterday's ending
where her mouth yelled obscene truths
at my covered in spit face.
Wheezing in and out there was a plethora,
there was an insistent flood of snot
snaking swiftly to the tip of her tongue.
It hung and dropped
and hit her knee and ran tumbled to shin, to toe
to the dirty floor.
But she was beautiful really
as she stood there
upset about who I am. 
I want the hand of god
to reach down and turn
back the odometer in my car
40, 50,000 miles
so I don't have to spend
Christmas at the Beaverton Auto Mart
staring at a turn-in
with cigarette butts on the the floor
ground into the carpet
pine needles around the tire wall
and that big man saying
"If you buy it today before
we clean it, it's $1000 less."
leaving me to wonder
about the price of dirt. 
Beneath the railway mist
Spawned from the underground
Far away from Life’s daunting struggle
My survival burdens none but myself
A faceless shadow while she hungers,
My shelter
Arises then leaves, eyes unhinged
The desire and restlessness she departs
Delicate tresses of divinity, haven
From the rain.
She believes my love to be untrue
Beyond these walls that keep us apart
The precious rebirth
Her touch trembles under the radiance
Shed by the tears of inferiority
And confusion
Masks of charm
The plastic smile
For once in my life
I span the waves of society
Collapsed to find
Strands of clear. 


I dreamed I saw you in your wedding gown
trailing weeds across the summer lawn.
Rusted silk against the burnished grass.
I watched you pass.

I dreamed I saw you in my husband’s room
standing by his careless bed, undone,
tissues sore and stitched in crimson thread,
your eyes rubbed red.
You turned your head.

I dreamed I saw you at the window-sill.
A blast of moonlight shapes a sheet of ice
which circles swiftly till it’s fully grasped
the startled twist of a bird snatched from flight.
She slides, she tumbles down the silver night,
falls soft as seeds fall, true as iron
and clean as ash.
Crouched and quiet in the shivering glass,
you loosen breath
and open bone.
I heard you laugh.

Repeat the instant when the future turned
and lost forever, never to reframe
the sudden angle of your lonely chin.
Repeat the instant; then again reborn,
begin again.


you'd better be there jesus
just the way you said you'd be
waiting up in heaven
now that you've set her free
your arms had best be open
and your smile had best be wide
you'd better be there jesus
when she makes the other side

she's likely to be frightened
she's likely not to know
exactly how she got
where'er it is she's going to go
so when radiant clouds part rampant
o'er that vast and shimm'ring sea
you had better be behind them
where she thinks you're going to be

you'd best be speaking English
not some far off foreign tongue
your hair had best be golden brown
your face had best be young
you'd better not be Catholic
and I pray you're not a Jew
she wasn't multicultural here
and death won't make her so

she was raised to stillness
and the darkness boredom brings
a desperate need to wear long sleeves
through hot midwestern springs
to sit lady-like as summer,
lush and stifled, rots to fall
and wait obedient even if
life never starts at all

I won't be looking for you
I worship elephants
with snaking arms and almond eyes
and graceful barefoot stance
with finger cymbals shrieking
and cornrows in their hair
they will dance the resurrection
I don't expect you there

I don't expect her either
my choice would make her ill
life's tangle left her proper soul
bewildered and unwell
indifference sapped her courage
fear destroyed her will
she can't embrace the joyous whirlwind
of my atavistic hell
but she believed you'd take her
for your sunbeam and the sight
of your sweet face would heal her
as she tumbled toward the light

so you'd damn well better be there
she did her very best
she's earned the place they promised her
in succor at your breast
the last rays of her only life
fade red to palest rose
jesus if you have a heart
I beg you hold her close
