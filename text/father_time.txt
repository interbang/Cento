Timeless Age
Matthew Fresquez

Father Time walked out on Mother Nature
He said “I’m tired of being your metronome”.
Mother replied “I need your help to keep things in order.
The world would be in entropy if I were left alone”
Father was tired of the job that came with matrimony.

He slammed the door behind him as he clutched the keys in his fist
Then he realized that the pistons would no longer fire right,
So he smiled and threw the keys back at the house
breaking the window,
landing with broken glass at the feet of the crying mother
With her elbows in her knees
And her face in her hands

It was time for Father to do his own thing
Time to explore the space he formerly regulated
Time to fuck time
“Maybe I’ll go check out the sixties again.”

“What about the children?” Mother moans to herself
Then she shoots to her feet with a wry equilibrium
“What about the children!”
she screams through the broken window
“What children?” Father replies
“They don’t even recognize us anymore”

Mother Nature watches
as Father Time walks off into the riddled distance
His body demolecularizes and fades into the wind

In a small beach town,
less than two hundred miles south of Haight Ashbury
Some young surf hippies load another bong as they wonder
what happened to the waves
And Bob Marley misses a beat,
Jerry Garcia finally comes back from his long strange trip
A stringy haired sibling inhales a stream of smoky
canaboids behind the gurgling sounds of water
And John Lennon runs by the window naked
Screaming out “I’ve never been born.”
The poor man knew what it meant not to have a father
How fortunate for us
This time.
