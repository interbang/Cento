*age*
/Janet Kuypers/

Sometimes, when I go out on a new date, I
feel like I'm sixteen again.
I'll rifle through my closet, deciding I have
absolutely nothing to wear.
He'll pick me up, and we'll go to a
restaurant with deer heads on the walls,
and we'll have whiskey sours, and we'll
struggle with the lettuce leaves in
the salads because they're too big, and
when we're done with dinner we'll go
to a bar that's so crowded and so loud that
we won't be able to talk to each
other, but we'll have to stand real close.
And then he'll take me home and I'll invite
him in, he'll sit on the chair,
I'll sit on the couch, and he'll ask for a glass
of water. When we can't
think of any more small talk, and the clock
says 3:12 a.m., I'll see him to
the door, he'll kiss me good-bye, and I'll
lock the door after he leaves. And
when I'm sure he can't see me through the
window, I'll turn on the stereo and
dance in my living room before I go to bed.
