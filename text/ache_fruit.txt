Ache's Fruit
A.R.Midgley

A few small questions, reservations
all requiring confirmations.
When you do, such comes to you
in many forms, and feelings too
with no remorse, forget regret -
I see you every day and yet
it’s not enough, I want more:
I want to walk you through a door
and then a hall, far blurred walls
where we could dance a waltzish ball,
just you and I, cheek on cheek
and in my ear a breathy squeak;
on my heart, gone's the ice,
your dress - liquefaction’s nice.
I’m pressed close, starts the heat,
your dress melts to floor of suite
steam from each, on each it lights
on terrace wind it makes its flight
famished hearts had nought to eat
expert tongues where life's not sweet
talk is dull expendable
passion shapes the floating hull
that transports us from mold to new
you with me and I in lieu
of your dream, unattained
but in life is now ordained.

Ahead this scene, so much precedes
because of morals' basic needs
but basics shrink less to lessers
when beyond is soft caressers
and the thought, at the core
that after this is so much more
