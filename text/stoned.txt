Moon in the sky Clouds on the ground Lost in mass wonder Falling from sound How do you stop suddenly?
The tires of a car screamed loudly On the freshly dampened pavement Into the cold, dry night air And there was a thud Like a twenty pound sack of potatoes being lobbed onto the deck of a boat And then a new scream Not quite as loud But more dramatic than the first And then there was a body
There was a kid, a boy Scarcely fifteen years old Stoned, happy, thinking, dreaming Walking home in the dusk From the party he'd just left The soft, wet air pressing Upon his face, and moistening His jacket.
As he lifted each foot forward He carelessly let it fall To the sidewalk without looking Where he was going. He'd been this route a million times And knew it by instinct. The lights and colors Were all on his side So, without even thinking He stepped off the rough, hard curb And into the street.
The driver was frightened By the sound of the screams As his auto came to a halt. And somehow, slowly He got out Staggered Glanced downwards Muttered Staggered back Got back in And drove away Fast.
Often I sit upon the bridge  That looms above the freeway And dream into the night air. The cars rush by underneath Sounding like huge swells and waves Rolling, crashing across the pavement And the road surfers grip their Wheels of death, firmly, as they weave In and out through traffic. Similar to the way The wave riders of history Guide their crafts through The spinning, falling tubes of excitement.
How fast does it take To kill yourself in a car? How fast does it take to die? Within the blink of an eye? Or a quick question why? Is life just a lie? I wonder and sigh...
