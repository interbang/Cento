*What Women
Really Want*
/Mychele/

/*

You think we want new furniture
a stove some major appliance
We only ask because
we can't get what we want.

That old stereotype about women spending money,
wanting jewelry,
wanting more more more

That's what we fall back on
when we can't get what we want.

A new house, a new car, new drapes are all far
from the truth of what we really seek.

Can't you see in our night eyes
Don't you feel the red silk of our negligee
Have you forgotten the smell of our essence?

Why can't you hear our request
through the lines?

We want you

And when you can't give us yourself anymore
we give up
and ask
for a dog.
