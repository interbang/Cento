`Moon in the sky
Clouds on the ground
Lost in mass wonder
Falling from sound
How do you stop suddenly?

The tires of a car screamed loudly
On the freshly dampened pavement
Into the cold, dry night air
And there was a thud
Like a twenty pound sack of potatoes
being lobbed onto the deck of a boat
And then a new scream
Not quite as loud
But more dramatic than the first
And then there was a body

There was a kid, a boy
Scarcely fifteen years old
Stoned, happy, thinking, dreaming
Walking home in the dusk
From the party he'd just left
The soft, wet air pressing
Upon his face, and moistening
His jacket.

As he lifted each foot forward
He carelessly let it fall
To the sidewalk without looking
Where he was going.
He'd been this route a million times
And knew it by instinct.
The lights and colors
Were all on his side
So, without even thinking
He stepped off the rough, hard curb
And into the street.

The driver was frightened
By the sound of the screams
As his auto came to a halt.
And somehow, slowly
He got out
Staggered
Glanced downwards
Muttered
Staggered back
Got back in
And drove away
Fast.

Often I sit upon the bridge
That looms above the freeway
And dream into the night air.
The cars rush by underneath
Sounding like huge swells and waves
Rolling, crashing across the pavement
And the road surfers grip their
Wheels of death, firmly, as they weave
In and out through traffic.
Similar to the way
The wave riders of history
Guide their crafts through
The spinning, falling tubes of excitement.

How fast does it take
To kill yourself in a car?
How fast does it take to die?
Within the blink of an eye?
Or a quick question why?
Is life just a lie?
I wonder and sigh...
A few small questions, reservations
all requiring confirmations.
When you do, such comes to you
in many forms, and feelings too
with no remorse, forget regret -
I see you every day and yet
it’s not enough, I want more:
I want to walk you through a door
and then a hall, far blurred walls
where we could dance a waltzish ball,
just you and I, cheek on cheek
and in my ear a breathy squeak;
on my heart, gone's the ice,
your dress - liquefaction’s nice.
I’m pressed close, starts the heat,
your dress melts to floor of suite
steam from each, on each it lights
on terrace wind it makes its flight
famished hearts had nought to eat
expert tongues where life's not sweet
talk is dull expendable
passion shapes the floating hull
that transports us from mold to new
you with me and I in lieu
of your dream, unattained
but in life is now ordained.

Ahead this scene, so much precedes
because of morals' basic needs
but basics shrink less to lessers
when beyond is soft caressers
and the thought, at the core
that after this is so much more 
Father Time walked out on Mother Nature
He said “I’m tired of being your metronome”.
Mother replied “I need your help to keep things in order.
The world would be in entropy if I were left alone”
Father was tired of the job that came with matrimony.

He slammed the door behind him as he clutched the keys in his fist
Then he realized that the pistons would no longer fire right,
So he smiled and threw the keys back at the house
breaking the window,
landing with broken glass at the feet of the crying mother
With her elbows in her knees
And her face in her hands

It was time for Father to do his own thing
Time to explore the space he formerly regulated
Time to fuck time
“Maybe I’ll go check out the sixties again.”

“What about the children?” Mother moans to herself
Then she shoots to her feet with a wry equilibrium
“What about the children!”
she screams through the broken window
“What children?” Father replies
“They don’t even recognize us anymore”

Mother Nature watches
as Father Time walks off into the riddled distance
His body demolecularizes and fades into the wind

In a small beach town,
less than two hundred miles south of Haight Ashbury
Some young surf hippies load another bong as they wonder
what happened to the waves
And Bob Marley misses a beat,
Jerry Garcia finally comes back from his long strange trip
A stringy haired sibling inhales a stream of smoky
canaboids behind the gurgling sounds of water
And John Lennon runs by the window naked
Screaming out “I’ve never been born.”
The poor man knew what it meant not to have a father
How fortunate for us
This time.
