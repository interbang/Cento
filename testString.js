`You think we want new furniture
a stove some major appliance
We only ask because
we can't get what we want.

That old stereotype about women spending money,
wanting jewelry,
wanting more more more

That's what we fall back on
when we can't get what we want.

A new house, a new car, new drapes are all far
from the truth of what we really seek.

Can't you see in our night eyes
Don't you feel the red silk of our negligee
Have you forgotten the smell of our essence?

Why can't you hear our request
through the lines?

We want you

And when you can't give us yourself anymore
we give up
and ask
for a dog.

Sometimes, when I go out on a new date, I
feel like I'm sixteen again.
I'll rifle through my closet, deciding I have
absolutely nothing to wear.
He'll pick me up, and we'll go to a
restaurant with deer heads on the walls,
and we'll have whiskey sours, and we'll
struggle with the lettuce leaves in
the salads because they're too big, and
when we're done with dinner we'll go
to a bar that's so crowded and so loud that
we won't be able to talk to each
other, but we'll have to stand real close.
And then he'll take me home and I'll invite
him in, he'll sit on the chair,
I'll sit on the couch, and he'll ask for a glass
of water. When we can't
think of any more small talk, and the clock
says 3:12 a.m., I'll see him to
the door, he'll kiss me good-bye, and I'll
lock the door after he leaves. And
when I'm sure he can't see me through the
window, I'll turn on the stereo and
dance in my living room before I go to bed.

Moon in the sky
Clouds on the ground
Lost in mass wonder
Falling from sound
How do you stop suddenly?

The tires of a car screamed loudly
On the freshly dampened pavement
Into the cold, dry night air
And there was a thud
Like a twenty pound sack of potatoes
being lobbed onto the deck of a boat
And then a new scream
Not quite as loud
But more dramatic than the first
And then there was a body

There was a kid, a boy
Scarcely fifteen years old
Stoned, happy, thinking, dreaming
Walking home in the dusk
From the party he'd just left
The soft, wet air pressing
Upon his face, and moistening
His jacket.

As he lifted each foot forward
He carelessly let it fall
To the sidewalk without looking
Where he was going.
He'd been this route a million times
And knew it by instinct.
The lights and colors
Were all on his side
So, without even thinking
He stepped off the rough, hard curb
And into the street.

The driver was frightened
By the sound of the screams
As his auto came to a halt.
And somehow, slowly
He got out
Staggered
Glanced downwards
Muttered
Staggered back
Got back in
And drove away
Fast.

Often I sit upon the bridge
That looms above the freeway
And dream into the night air.
The cars rush by underneath
Sounding like huge swells and waves
Rolling, crashing across the pavement
And the road surfers grip their
Wheels of death, firmly, as they weave
In and out through traffic.
Similar to the way
The wave riders of history
Guide their crafts through
The spinning, falling tubes of excitement.

How fast does it take
To kill yourself in a car?
How fast does it take to die?
Within the blink of an eye?
Or a quick question why?
Is life just a lie?
I wonder and sigh...

A few small questions, reservations
all requiring confirmations.
When you do, such comes to you
in many forms, and feelings too
with no remorse, forget regret -
I see you every day and yet
it’s not enough, I want more:
I want to walk you through a door
and then a hall, far blurred walls
where we could dance a waltzish ball,
just you and I, cheek on cheek
and in my ear a breathy squeak;
on my heart, gone's the ice,
your dress - liquefaction’s nice.
I’m pressed close, starts the heat,
your dress melts to floor of suite
steam from each, on each it lights
on terrace wind it makes its flight
famished hearts had nought to eat
expert tongues where life's not sweet
talk is dull expendable
passion shapes the floating hull
that transports us from mold to new
you with me and I in lieu
of your dream, unattained
but in life is now ordained.

Ahead this scene, so much precedes
because of morals' basic needs
but basics shrink less to lessers
when beyond is soft caressers
and the thought, at the core
that after this is so much more 
Father Time walked out on Mother Nature
He said “I’m tired of being your metronome”.
Mother replied “I need your help to keep things in order.
The world would be in entropy if I were left alone”
Father was tired of the job that came with matrimony.

He slammed the door behind him as he clutched the keys in his fist
Then he realized that the pistons would no longer fire right,
So he smiled and threw the keys back at the house
breaking the window,
landing with broken glass at the feet of the crying mother
With her elbows in her knees
And her face in her hands

It was time for Father to do his own thing
Time to explore the space he formerly regulated
Time to fuck time
“Maybe I’ll go check out the sixties again.”

“What about the children?” Mother moans to herself
Then she shoots to her feet with a wry equilibrium
“What about the children!”
she screams through the broken window
“What children?” Father replies
“They don’t even recognize us anymore”

Mother Nature watches
as Father Time walks off into the riddled distance
His body demolecularizes and fades into the wind

In a small beach town,
less than two hundred miles south of Haight Ashbury
Some young surf hippies load another bong as they wonder
what happened to the waves
And Bob Marley misses a beat,
Jerry Garcia finally comes back from his long strange trip
A stringy haired sibling inhales a stream of smoky
canaboids behind the gurgling sounds of water
And John Lennon runs by the window naked
Screaming out “I’ve never been born.”
The poor man knew what it meant not to have a father
How fortunate for us
This time.
inside his heart
she saw light
crying to get out
and follow a dream in the sky
he was darn and silent
only her magic could turn
winter to spring
and he was in love
together they flew
and twirled a silly song
upon time
they went slowly at night
and nestled in a cocoon
where they were happy...


I want to write a poem that will get me laid
I wanna drop the bomb upon every woman
That will make them believe I’m the hottest thing

See, I’m not as cool as McQueen or James Dean
I can’t keep a poker-face if I’m holding more than a king
I don’t have a Kirk Douglas chin with a gritty smile
Or Fred Astaire grace, flawless in style
I don’t embrace the force like Obi One Kenobi
I don’t have money like Trump or hair like Bon Jovi

I want to write a poem that will get me laid
My words will have to be tactful
Subtle, yet unafraid
Sublime words that will softly stroke
The pulse of her femininity
Taunting words with feathery trails
That will tantalize a need for remedy

I don’t have an athletic build
I’m not in the top of my field
(I don’t even have a field)
I don’t have the charm of a secret agent spy
Or dark mysterious eyes
I just have this compass with a magnet jammed in its side
I want to write a poem that’ll get me laid
It would have to build me an air
Of sensuality and knowingness
Try to keep that slow, grinding, beat
Smoky, jazz funk, fluid heat

An indistinct warmth that will have to be satisfied
The rising of yawning lust
Like a vapor
Deep inside

Yeah, that’s the way
I’m gonna write a poem that will get me laid
One that will drive her
Drive her to the very brink

But... But... But...
I think I just ran out of ink


twenty two checks are all one needs
there need not be security or control
just twenty two checks
perhaps a jacket,
with black and white stains
or maybe some oversized socks
I know she shouldn’t be doing this
but it feels so good
twenty two checks and
our Christmas is saved
twenty two checks and santa
is as fat and jolly as ever
are they kidding? don’t they know?
my mother has twenty two checks
a lot of things to buy
she’s not through yet,
where are you going
mom I need you to help me escape
from your insanity
which is so appealing
in its innocence and infanity I want
twenty two checks and
a black and white smeared coat
to become you is my greatest object
and of fear I run from you
because I am the last of the great
mother lovers and twenty two checks
is nothing to me
it’s simply another exercise of your godliness

I pray
to your apotheosis
what would monsignor lawler say
if he were to love us now
we are no longer apart,
but partners in crime together
I’ll chase the pigs from the pen
and run with you into
our great neckian utopia
and pretend that we sit around
the tape recorder listening to your authoritarian,
entrepreneurial begetter
ask us what we want.
as our turn comes around
we will whisper quietly
twenty two checks!
and santa will come
and give us our book of ecstasy
come lets go
to all those vultures who wait
in their decorated nests for
our twenty two checks which
may never come true,
simply scribblings upon a paper
which will eventually be cashed in
for parker’s with black
and white spills that come to signify
our innocence and incapability in a
scientific world where numbers must
match ledgers and people must be
paid for their black and white atrocities
the elasticity of their economy
depends upon us
we are needed to give them meaning
and truth we signify
the vilified other half which
gives them the mirror through
which they primp their angled nostrils
come lets give them
something to do today
we‘ve got twenty two checks
and a new cross pen
let’s write them our love letter which
will only be sneered at
let’s give them notes about us
let’s invite them into our
world which they could never understand
22 checks fifteen hundred dollars
its all the same to us
the balancing act bored
the greatest minds of the experiment
we must push the acrobat
from the tightrope on purpose
watch him hit the ground painfully hard
and wonder why equilibrium fueled his fall
why balance
finally claimed him
consumed him devoured him
the unbalanced principle is ours and
will not be understood
by those acrobats who have something to lose when their
balance is jeopardized
let us unbalance the world set it to rights
and cash our
twenty two checks twenty two times in
twenty two different ways.


How horrible a thing is death:
Non-consciousness, absence of breath.
Life’s predestined start we celebrate,
Yet how arbitrary its ending,
Determined by fate.
Horrible death: monumental
(Then why so pending an event?)
Perhaps the cure to the habit of life is Insignificant.

How troublesome a thing is dying:
An utter end for one,
For few a cause for crying.
For the rest in existence a speck in the eye
(At most a reminder that they too will die)
Such a nuisance, a disruption—
There’s work to be done!
How selfish is man’s great horror of death
For it troubles only one.


Men love sluts my best
friend’s cousin
croons, a sixteen year old authority
fresh from juvenile hall.
So we push up our 12 year old baby tits.
add mascara and body glitter.
Pose for our own approval.

That summer my friend disappears
not seen again ‘til age 17.
I’m clerking that year at the drugstore.
She comes in with a drug addict’s face,
housewife’s hands, no wedding ring.
Purchases some diapers.
averting her eyes from mine.

High school I find a new best friend
with a different name and haircolor
but the same weak, pretty voice.

Helpless at pleading no,
at twisting her body under his,
she comes back to school in her
mother’s glasses, hiding two black eyes.
Her world reduced to hospital vials
praying for the monthly tremble of blood,
a negative HIV result.

She recovered into a softer voice
and a shakier walk.
Started splaying her ivory candlestick legs
at a strip club on the other side of town.
Lost her name to Honey.

So I should have known better
than to make love to a man
who entered me like he was walking on stage.
Thinking I’d leave something more
behind than lipstick stains on his carpet,
hair clogging his drain.

This city is full of girls
who paint their mouths
the color of whores’ fingernails,
thinking they’ll find
a man who’ll love them.
Men love sluts.
but not the way they love their Mamas,
not the way they love Jesus.


Morning pushes amber fingers of light
through the blinds,
but here
the sun amounts to nothing.

Even the bed is wrong.
Busy sheets, fat pillows.

She longs to lose
her insect flesh
in the white sterility of a hospital.
To have nurses, needles,
eat up the overabundance
of the hours.

She hates herself. But she is beautiful.
Skin like
white porcelain:
Toilet.
Teeth.
One will rot the other.

There are easier ways to die,
but none dizzier
than slowly vomiting yourself
back into the corner
you think you belong to.

Girls wait
for lovers with fingers like
delicate birds
to teach them how to fly.

Mothers, tell your daughters.

Too many of my sisters
are crouching in the corner,
wearing their bodies
like wounds.
my life is that rare bootleg always illegal if you speak it
the women who leave me love me
from porch swing views I lose
all the birthday wishes I've ever spit up on cake
my home is heated, the outside grows and growls
everything gets bigger except my outlook. 
Loaded to middle
Pickled and pure
Plastered like putty
Blind as a door
Stewed boiled and juiced
Polluted and poor
Jagged over heels
Oiled and sore
Smashed like a pumpkin
As full as a tick
Sozzled and tanked
Full to the tip
With black teeth afloat
Sefaring in the suds
Swazzled and Zonked
One more was then chugged
Lit up like a Christmas tree
And high as a kite
Blue around the gills
Bosko Absoluto Bosky that night
Stinkarooed stiff
I was knee walking drunk. 


he's a 4 prong plug in a 3 prong world
not wired into the rest of us. always
thinking of snakes and dancing, all elbows,
in sunlit corners with dust motes and dreams

but she loves him
when he whispers words. the words
that slither. tingle with her sadness
as they make love on the futon
in a circle of candles melting
on hardwood floors warped
with the rings of beer bottles
left when the empties are tossed

and she has to believe
in the letter that never comes
in the genius nobody sees
to keep from drowning herself
in the deep fat fryer down at the mall
giving into a dark so empty
of dust motes and dreams
