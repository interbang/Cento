        <h3>Father Time walked out on Mother Nature</h3>
        <h3>He said “I’m tired of being your metronome”.</h3>
        <h3>Mother replied “I need your help to keep things in order.</h3>
        <h3>The world would be in entropy if I were left alone”</h3>
        <h3>Father was tired of the job that came with matrimony.</h3>

        <h3>He slammed the door behind him as he clutched the keys in his fist</h3>
        <h3>Then he realized that the pistons would no longer fire right,</h3>
        <h3>So he smiled and threw the keys back at the house</h3>
        <h3>breaking the window,</h3>
        <h3>landing with broken glass at the feet of the crying mother</h3>
        <h3>With her elbows in her knees</h3>
        <h3>And her face in her hands</h3>
      </section>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <section>
        <h3>It was time for Father to do his own thing</h3>
        <h3>Time to explore the space he formerly regulated</h3>
        <h3>Time to fuck time</h3>
        <h3>“Maybe I’ll go check out the sixties again.”</h3>
      </section>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <section>
        <h3>“What about the children?” Mother moans to herself</h3>
        <h3>Then she shoots to her feet with a wry equilibrium</h3>
        <h3>“What about the children!”</h3>
        <h3>she screams through the broken window</h3>
        <h3>“What children?” Father replies</h3>
        <h3>“They don’t even recognize us anymore”</h3>
      </section>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <section>
        <h3>Mother Nature watches</h3>
        <h3>as Father Time walks off into the riddled distance</h3>
        <h3>His body demolecularizes and fades into the wind</h3>
      </section>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <section>
        <h3>In a small beach town,</h3>
        <h3>less than two hundred miles south of Haight Ashbury</h3>
        <h3>Some young surf hippies load another bong as they wonder</h3>
        <h3>what happened to the waves</h3>
        <h3>And Bob Marley misses a beat,</h3>
        <h3>Jerry Garcia finally comes back from his long strange trip</h3>
        <h3>A stringy haired sibling inhales a stream of smoky</h3>
        <h3>canaboids behind the gurgling sounds of water</h3>
        <h3>And John Lennon runs by the window naked</h3>
        <h3>Screaming out “I’ve never been born.”</h3>
        <h3>The poor man knew what it meant not to have a father</h3>
        <h3>How fortunate for us</h3>
        <h3>This time.</h3>
